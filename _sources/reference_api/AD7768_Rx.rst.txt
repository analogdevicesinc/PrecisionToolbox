Class Properties
================

**EnabledChannels Enabled Channels**
   Indexs of channels to be enabled. Input should be a [1xN] vector with the indexes of channels to be enabled. Order is irrelevant

**SampleRate Sample Rate**
   Baseband sampling rate in Hz, specified as a scalar in samples per second. Options are: '256000','128000','64000','32000','16000','8000','4000', '2000','1000'

**SamplesPerFrame Samples Per Frame**
   Number of samples per frame, specified as an even positive integer from 2 to 16,777,216. Using values less than 3660 can yield poor performance.

**URI - remote host URI**
   Hostname or IP address of remote libIIO deviceHelp for adi.AD7768.Rx/uri is inherited from superclass matlabshared.libiio.base
