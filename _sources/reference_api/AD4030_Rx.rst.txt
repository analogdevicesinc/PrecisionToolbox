Class Properties
================

**EnabledChannels Enabled Channels**
   Indexs of channels to be enabled. Input should be a [1xN] vector with the indexes of channels to be enabled. Order is irrelevant

**SampleAveragingLength**
   Block length of samples to be averaged. Applied in the Averaging Mode register only when OUT_DATA_MD is set to 30-bit averaged differential modeHelp for adi.AD4030.Rx/SampleAveragingLength is inherited from superclass adi.AD463x.Base

**SampleRate Sample Rate**
   Baseband sampling rate in Hz, specified as a scalar in samples per second.Help for adi.AD4030.Rx/SampleRate is inherited from superclass adi.AD463x.Base

**SamplesPerFrame Samples Per Frame**
   Number of samples per frame, specified as an even positive integer.Help for adi.AD4030.Rx/SamplesPerFrame is inherited from superclass adi.AD463x.Base

**URI - remote host URI**
   Hostname or IP address of remote libIIO deviceHelp for adi.AD4030.Rx/uri is inherited from superclass matlabshared.libiio.base
